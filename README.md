🚀 Bento Grid Web Page
A responsive Bento-style grid layout built with HTML and CSS as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge. This project helped me practice advanced CSS Grid techniques, media queries, and component layout strategies to match a real-world design closely.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – Semantic structure and accessibility considerations

CSS3 – Grid layout, Flexbox, custom properties, responsive design

Media Queries – For mobile-first responsiveness

Google Fonts – Typography

Git and GitHub – Version control and deployment

🎯 Objectives
Replicate the Bento grid layout from the challenge design

Ensure the design is fully responsive across screen sizes

Use semantic HTML and scalable CSS techniques

Make sure left-column desktop components stack at the bottom on mobile

📱 Responsive Design
Desktop Layout: A clean and modern grid layout using CSS Grid.

Mobile Layout: The left sidebar content stacks underneath using grid-template-areas and media queries.

Built mobile-first and scaled up for larger screens.
